This is my project, I didn't do the whole task just a part of it!
For some reason I couldn't fetch the data from the database using the id of the product
I couldn't add more than 3 columns to the item table again I don't know why
I handled most of the errors that can come from the form inputs
the db is in the repository you need to zip it and add it to the database!
Good luck!
